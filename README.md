# Diabetes Prediction App

This is a Flask web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, age, and number of pregnancies.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict diabetes based on health parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web app provides an easy-to-use form for inputting health data.
- **PDF Report Generation**: After the prediction, the app generates a PDF report summarizing the input data and prediction result.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework to create the server and handle requests.
- **scikit-learn**: For training and running the machine learning model.
- **matplotlib**: For generating visualizations.
- **Bootstrap**: To create a responsive and modern UI.
- **Python**: Backend language to handle logic and model predictions.
